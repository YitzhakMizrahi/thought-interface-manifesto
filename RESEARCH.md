# Current State of Neural Interface Research

## What Works Today
- Basic mental state detection (focused vs. relaxed)
- Simple binary choices (yes/no, left/right)
- Emotional valence detection (positive/negative affect)

## What Doesn't Work Yet
- Complex thought decoding from EEG alone
- Consistent cross-user neural patterns
- Real-time natural language from brain signals

## Research Gaps We Aim to Address
- Ethical frameworks for neural data
- User-controlled personalization of decoders
- Privacy-preserving neural signal processing
