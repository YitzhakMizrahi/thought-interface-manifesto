## Thought Interface Manifesto

**Designing Mind-Tech for Human Sovereignty**

A declaration of principles for building the future of brain-computer interaction â€” with ethics, autonomy, and healing at the core.

This repo hosts:

* The original manifesto
* Principles for ethical neural interface design
* A call to conscious builders, researchers, and futurists

We envision a world where technology does not extract from the mind, but **respects it** â€” and enables the next evolution of human agency.

> "The future of human-computer interaction is the future of human freedom."
