## Thought Interface Manifesto

**Designing Mind-Tech for Human Sovereignty**

A declaration of principles for building the future of brain-computer interaction — with ethics, autonomy, and healing at the core.

This repo hosts:

* The original manifesto
* Principles for ethical neural interface design
* A call to conscious builders, researchers, and futurists

We envision a world where technology does not extract from the mind, but **respects it** — and enables the next evolution of human agency.

> "The future of human-computer interaction is the future of human freedom."

### 🔬 Current Status
This is a living document in active development. The technology described doesn't fully exist yet - and that's precisely why we need ethical frameworks now, before capability outpaces wisdom.

### 🤝 Who This Is For
- Neural interface researchers and developers
- Ethicists working on emerging technology
- Accessibility advocates and neurodivergent communities
- Anyone who believes technology should serve human flourishing

### 📢 Get Involved

This is an open conversation. If you believe in designing neural interfaces that respect the soul, we invite you to:

* Submit issues with ideas or edge-cases
* Add additional principles
* Share reflections or applications
