## Thought Interface Principles

### 1. User-Sovereign Interpretation

The user should own, train, and control their own brain-to-text decoder.

### 2. Consent as a Living Protocol

Capture only with active, conscious, and interruptible permission.

### 3. No Surveillance or Social Control

Inner cognition must not be mined for marketing, punishment, or profiling.

### 4. Open Ecosystem

Mind-interface protocols and tools should be open-source, auditable, and communally governed.

### 5. Healing First

Use cases that prioritize self-awareness, journaling, and emotional clarity should precede performance or productivity goals.

### 6. Reject Mind-Based Coercion

No employment, education, or platform should condition participation on brain signal analysis.
